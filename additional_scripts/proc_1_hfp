#          where indir   -  directory for processed data--base name

#  jch 2002/09/04
# CJS - 01/12/04 - changed bindir for data user
#
# SJM - 04/07/2009 - changed bindir to /usr/local/bin
#  SJM 2010/08/02 altered paths to support processing in individual accounts
#                 expects Procdata to be at $HOME/$CRUISE/Procdata
#                 and scripts in $HOME/bin
#
# SJM 2012/06/12 Adapted from proc_1_ctd
# SJM 2013/08/06 Adapted to HFP from CT2
