# Usage: process_1_ct2  <indir>  <lowering> <cruise> <vehicle> 
#          where indir   -  directory for processed data--base name
#	   where lowering    - lowering id, eg j2-002
#	   where cruise  - cruise id, eg altv7l20 
#	   where veh  	 - vehicle id, eg j2 or argo or dsl120

#  jch 2002/09/04
# CJS - 01/12/04 - changed bindir for data user
#
# SJM - 04/07/2009 - changed bindir to /usr/local/bin
#  SJM 2010/08/02 altered paths to support processing in individual accounts
#                 expects Procdata to be at $HOME/$CRUISE/Procdata
#                 and scripts in $HOME/bin
#
# SJM 2012/06/12 Adapted from proc_1_ctd
